# Wordy

### A web application for English-as-Second-Language (ESL) individuals who want to expand their vocabulary.

As an immigrant growing up in America, expanding my English vocabulary has been a lifelong pursuit. Without a doubt, opening up a dictionary to learn new words can be an overwhelming experience for many. As a result, I decided to use my newly accumulated JavaScript knowledge to bring Wordy to life in order to provide a more engaging and interactive word-learning experience for all. I'd like to dedicate this app to all my ESL folks!
